            <h4><strong>Technologies Used: </strong>Java, SQL (Oracle), JDBC</h4>
            <h4><strong>Summary:</strong> Developed a Java Application which executes SQL queries against a relational database and places the results in special data structures.</h4>
            <h4><strong>Background and Premise: </strong> </h4>
                <p>This project uses a fictional Facebook-like database with tables that stores different types of user data, including location, friends, educational history, tagged photos, etc. Because the contents of the database were organized in differing data forms, I was to create efficient Java functions that both extracted and stored the results into their appropriate structures. The task of querying this database through Java required relevant knowledge of the schema of the database and a familiarity of the methods of Java Database Connectivity. Nine queries were performed on the database, each ranging in complexity. Statements and ResultSet operations were among the most widely employed throughout the project.</p>
            
        <h4><strong>Results:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <p id= "ul-head">Completion of the following complex queries:</p>
            <li>Returned the top "num" pairs of users with the most mutual friends who are not friends themselves.</li>
            <li>Returned pairs of "unrealized" friendships in which the following conditions had to be met:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The two users are the same gender</li>
                <li>The two users are tagged in at least one common photo</li>
                <li>The two users are not friends</li>
                <li>The difference in the two users' birth years is less than or equal to "yearDiff"</li>
            
            </ul>
            <p>*Results were sorted in descending order by number of photos tagged together.</p>
            <li>Returned the top "num" photos with the most tagged users sorted in descending order by the number of tagged users.</li>

            <h4><strong>Summary:</strong> Created a JSON file that was used to populate a MongoDB collection, and perform queries on the data.</h4>
            <h4><strong>Background and Premise: </strong> </h4>
                <p>This project used the same schema as the database used in the <i>JDBC Project</i>, but with different goals and concepts. In this project, I extracted data from tables in the Facebook-like database and exported a JSON file output.json that contained information about the users. Then, I used that JSON file (and others generated of the same format), into MongoDB to create a MongoDB collection of users. These tasks allowed me to feel comfortable with the processes of loading data and querying results from a NoSQL database manager as it differs from SQL DBMS.</p>
            <h4><strong>Results:</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Successful creation and writing of JSON file to disk via FileWriter</li> <li>Used JSONObjects, JSONArrays to select and store data of different tables</li>

            <h4><strong>Background and Premise: </strong> </h4>
                <p>For this project, I used a public dataset that contained information about crimes that occurred in Detroit, Michigan from the last 20 years. The dataset was large and contained information about the type of crime, the location of the crime, the date and time of the crime, and other relevant information. I used Python and various libraries to analyze and visualize the data in order to identify trends and patterns. I used Pandas to clean and manipulate the data, Matplotlib to create visualizations, Folium to create interactive maps (notably heat maps), and iPywidgets to create interactive widgets.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Identified the most common types of crimes in Detroit</li>

                <li>Created maps and charts grouped by year, then by crime</li>
                <li>Identified trends and patterns in the data</li>

            <h4><strong>Summary:</strong>Performed extensive research into the behavior of U.S. tornadoes with heavy mapping and statistical analysis.</h4>
            <h4><strong>Background and Premise: </strong> </h4>
            <p>In a group of four, this month-long project consisted of three main parts, examining the .csv data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), detailing tornadoes in the United States recorded from 1950-2023. First, we inspected the dataset as a whole, and categorized the periodic behavior of tornadoes to reveal any trends or patterns. This included linear regression among other statistical methods. Secondly, to measure the impact of elevation on the intensity and frequency of tornadoes, we performed a small-scale study only on the tornadoes in Texas, from which we categorized three levels of elevation to compare. Thirdly, we corroborated our Texas conclusions on the national scale through gdal geographic mapping and data analysis.</p>

            <h4><strong>Technologies Used: </strong>C++, Relational DBMS</h4>
            <h4><strong>Summary:</strong> Emulated the Grace Hash Join Algorithm for relational databases in C++.</h4>
            <h4><strong>Background and Premise: </strong> </h4>
            <p>Grace Hash Join is a join algorithm that is used to join two relations in a database. It is a disk-based join algorithm that is used when the relations are too large to fit in memory. The algorithm has two main phases: partition and probe. In the partition phase, the algorithm partitions the relations into buckets based on a hash function. In the probe phase, the algorithm probes the buckets to find matching tuples and re-hashes if necessary. In this project, I implemented the partition and probe functions of the Grace Hash Join algorithm in C++. I was given starter files that simulated the data flow of records in disk and memory and performed a join operation between two relations.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Implemented the partition and probe functions of the Grace Hash Join algorithm in C++</li>

            <h3>Bank Transaction Simulator</h3>
            <h4><strong>Technologies Used: </strong>C++ (Queues, Unordered Sets and Maps)</h4>
            <h4><strong>Summary:</strong> Simulated a bank transaction system using queues and unordered sets and maps in C++.</h4>
            <h4><strong>Background and Premise: </strong> </h4>
            <p>The bank wire transfer simulator project I completed aimed to provide practical experience in selecting and utilizing appropriate data structures in C++. The project involved simulating the operations of a bank's wire transfer system, requiring the efficient handling of various data processing tasks. These tasks including login, logout, and placing transactions. I used queues, unordered maps, and unordered sets to manage and optimize these tasks effectively, and simulate bank "feeing" logic, all while correctly updating user information and history. The program was also able to point out invalid or corrupted transaction requests and give daily summaries of transactions that occurred. The successful completion of this project demonstrated my ability to apply theoretical knowledge of data structures to solve real-world problems efficiently, showcasing proficiency in C++ programming and algorithm design.</p>
            <h4><strong>Results:</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented a bank transaction simulator in C++</li>
